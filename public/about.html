<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I'm Rodson Matos Cavalcante dos Santos (Rodson Matos or simply Baiano). I'm a majoring in Information Systens on Tiradentes University. Though, this major do not fullfil the reason of my existence, my perfeccionism just would not allow me do a poor work. I always try to excel in my obligations.</p>
<h3>Me?</h3>
<p>I'm a guy who loves studying and learning, from the basics subjects to the hardest and most complex. Actually, I use Python for most of my projects just because the familiarity with the language than other reasons. I'm planning to learn, and I'm learning, Html, CSS, and JavaScript (the basic of web development), Django, or Flask, or both (why not), and many other tools for web. I was used to do some simple codes in C and Java, but the former is the one I want to stick with - I like the concept of having a very powerful tool to do things, even the simpler ones.
There are other languages in my wishlist as Lua (it's brazilian! *patriotic noise*), lisp, rust, and something else that I just forgot. The first two for configuring NeoVim and Emacs, and the third for... I don't know, I just want.</p>
<p>As I said, I love studying and learning everything, but the areas that fullfil my existence, that gives reason to my being (part of it), is Philosophy and Mathematics. They simply wonder me in a way that puts me closer to God, the Truth Itself.</p>
<p>Last and THE MOST IMPORTANT, there is God. He is the true reason of me, the Being of my being. That gave us His oown Son to die for our salvation, Jesus Christ, True God and True Man, Your Blessed Mother, Mary, and the Catholic Church.</p>
